- a .vue file is a custom file format that uses html-like syntax
- describes a portion of the UI
- consists of three types of top-level language blocks
    - <template></template>
    - <script></script>
    - <style></style>
- template is like the html stuff
- script is the script
- style is the style
- they come together into one file
- remember: a browser has no idea what a .vue file is
    - a webpack with vue loader is going to parse this file
    - extract the three blocks
    - assemble them back to a format that browsers cna understnad
    - all of this is taken care of in the vue CLI
- a component is a .vue file
but why?
- component scoped css: its css will apply to elements of the current component only.
